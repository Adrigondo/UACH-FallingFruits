## What is a GDD?
A game design document (GDD) is a software design document that serves as a blueprint from which your game is to be built. It helps you define the scope of your game and sets the general direction for the project, keeping the entire team on the same page.

A GDD usually includes:

- Executive summary (game concept, genre, target audience, project scope, etc.)

- Gameplay (objectives, game progressions, in-game GUI, etc.)

- Mechanics (rules, combat, physics, etc.)

- Game elements (worldbuilding, story, characters, locations, level design, etc.)

-Assets (music, sound effects, 2D/3D models, etc.)

## How to write a GDD
Modern game design documentation process follows several best practices:

- Keep the game documentation lightweight. The original game concept doesnâ€™t always work out. You might have to scrap the game, or pivot in a different direction. Either way, keep the inital documentation to a minimum so you don't have to rewrite a multi-page document. Fit it on a single page and let it evolve from there.
- Write the GDD collaboratively. Unless you are an indie game developer working solo, involve your team in the process from the start. Make your GDD the central hub where your team members discover, discuss, and solve issues together.
- The GDD should evolve together with the project. A GDD is only useful when it's up-to-date. Choose a documentation tool that preserves a version history and let your design document evolve together with your game by updating it daily.
- Use visual aids. Don't let your readers drown in text. Many ideas can be much more clearly conveyed using graphs, flow charts, and concept art. Or turn your entire game design doc into a mind map and watch it grow as your game evolves.
