##### Sunday, May 19, 2024
This is the first day with notations. I made a GDD with the basic and ideal specifications of the game. I'll try to achieve all that.
###### Challenges
- The backgrounds. It is a too hard task to desing a background, and, if I fit with the history, i will have to develop at least 7 backgrounds.
- I can't do the tongue to strech with Inverse Kinematics, wich is a great challengu right now.
